# AstalonTracker

PopTracker pack for Astalon: Tears of the Earth

## Installation

1. Add the "astalon-poptracker" folder into your poptracker/packs folder.
2. In PopTracker, click on the folder in the top left and navigate to the Astalon tracker.
3. There are boxes all over the map of varying colors, they represent the following: 
    Green - Can get
    Red - Can't get
    Orange - Can get some items in a given area but not all of them
    Yellow - Can reach by breaking logic
4. Poptracker has a broadcast view designed to be used as a display on streams and videos. You can open this popout window by clicking the radio tower button next to the settings button in the top left corner.

## Notes

- I have not yet figured out how to autotrack progressive settings, so they must be toggled manually for now (i.e. Free Apex, etc).
- As with the randomizer itself, logic is a WIP. That being said, if something is blatantly not correct, please let me know.
